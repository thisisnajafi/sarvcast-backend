# EPISODE ACCESS PREMIUM ISSUE - FINAL FIX

## ✅ ISSUE RESOLVED

The episode detail endpoint was returning `PREMIUM_REQUIRED` error even though:
- ✅ Profile endpoint shows user is premium
- ✅ User has active subscription with proper end_date
- ✅ Subscription status is 'active'

## 🔍 ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED

The `AccessControlService::hasPremiumAccess()` method was using a **different query** than the User model's `activeSubscription` relationship:

### Before (Inconsistent):
```php
// AccessControlService - Manual query
$activeSubscription = Subscription::where('user_id', $userId)
                                 ->where('status', 'active')
                                 ->where('end_date', '>', now())
                                 ->first();

// User Model - Uses activeSubscription relationship
$activeSubscription = $user->activeSubscription; // Uses Subscription::active() scope
```

### After (Consistent):
```php
// AccessControlService - Now uses same logic as User model
$activeSubscription = $user->activeSubscription;

// User Model - Same as before
$activeSubscription = $user->activeSubscription;
```

## 🛠️ FIX APPLIED

**File:** `app/Services/AccessControlService.php`

**Changed:** `hasPremiumAccess()` method now uses `$user->activeSubscription` instead of manual query.

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **Consistent logic** across all premium checks
- ✅ **Same results** as profile endpoint
- ✅ **Uses proven working relationship**
- ✅ **Maintains comprehensive logging**

## 🧪 TESTING COMMANDS

### Test Premium Access:
```bash
php artisan test:premium-access 3
```

### Test Episode Access:
```bash
php artisan test:episode-access 3 1
```

### Test Telegram Notification:
```bash
php artisan telegram:test-sales-notification 12
```

## 📱 EXPECTED RESULTS

### Before Fix:
```json
GET /api/v1/episodes/1
{
    "success": false,
    "message": "برای دسترسی به این قسمت اشتراک فعال نیاز است",
    "error_code": "PREMIUM_REQUIRED"
}
```

### After Fix:
```json
GET /api/v1/episodes/1
{
    "success": true,
    "data": {
        "episode": { ... },
        "access_info": {
            "has_access": true,
            "reason": "premium_subscription",
            "message": "دسترسی با اشتراک فعال"
        }
    }
}
```
