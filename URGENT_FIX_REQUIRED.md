## CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED

The subscription ID 12 STILL has `end_date = null` even though status is 'active'.

This is why the user is not detected as premium:
- status = 'active' ✅
- end_date = null ❌ (MUST be a future date)

## IMMEDIATE FIX REQUIRED

You MUST run ONE of these commands:

### Option 1: SQL Command (Run this in your database NOW)
```sql
UPDATE subscriptions 
SET end_date = '2025-11-04 13:49:32' 
WHERE id = 12;
```

### Option 2: Use the Manual Activation API
```bash
POST /api/v1/subscriptions/debug/subscription/12/activate
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN
```

### Option 3: Laravel Tinker (Run in terminal)
```bash
php artisan tinker
```
Then:
```php
$sub = \App\Models\Subscription::find(12);
$sub->end_date = \Carbon\Carbon::parse('2025-11-04 13:49:32');
$sub->save();
echo "End date set to: " . $sub->end_date;
exit;
```

## VERIFICATION

After running ONE of the above commands, the end_date MUST change from null to a date.

Run this SQL to verify:
```sql
SELECT id, status, start_date, end_date FROM subscriptions WHERE id = 12;
```

Expected result:
- end_date should be '2025-11-04 13:49:32' (NOT null)

## WHY THIS HAPPENS

The PaymentService should set end_date during payment callback, but it's not working.
This is the bug we need to fix in the payment processing logic.

For now, manually set the end_date, then we'll fix the root cause.
