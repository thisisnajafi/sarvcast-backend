## Full Prompt

```
Create a photorealistic 3D smartphone mockup in vertical portrait orientation with these exact specifications:

**Output dimensions:** 1080 x 1920 pixels (9:16 vertical).

**Device:** A modern smartphone with a slim metallic frame (light gray or silver), very thin bezels, smoothly rounded corners, and a small black pill-shaped camera notch at the top center of the screen. The phone is shown at a slight angle, floating against a rich, layered background. Lighting is soft and diffused, with subtle gradients on the phone surface and a soft, wide shadow beneath the device for depth.

**Background – rich gradient, no white:** Do **not** use a white or near-white background. Instead use a **smooth, rich gradient** that fills the frame and feels premium and kids-friendly. For example:
- A gradient that transitions from a brighter cyan or teal (#00BCD4, #26C6DA) at the top to a deeper violet, soft purple, or warm coral (#9C27B0, #E91E63, or #FF5722) at the bottom—or a similar gradient in SarvCast brand colors. The colors should be **clearly visible and saturated**, with a slight luminous quality, so the background never reads as white or washed out.
- Within the gradient you may add **very subtle** soft light glows or gentle, indistinct texture—nothing busy. The goal is a polished, premium look like a high-end app promo: rich color, depth, and clarity.

**Background elements – sparse and elegant (not many particles):** Add **only a few** floating elements—**do not** fill the frame with lots of small particles, confetti, or dots. Instead:
- Use **3 to 6 larger**, translucent, glassy, or soft 3D shapes (e.g. simple icons like a heart, a star, or a play button; or soft orbs/blobs) in brand colors (cyan, orange, soft pink). Place them at **varying depths**—some slightly blurred to suggest distance—so they add depth without clutter.
- These elements should feel **sparse and intentional**, like the reference mockup: a few floating items that add interest and a premium, uncluttered feel. **Avoid** dense confetti, many small sparkles, or busy patterns that make the background feel crowded or noisy.

**Screen content:** Replace the entire phone screen with the SarvCast application home page image I am providing [or: "Image 2" / "the second uploaded image"]. The screen must show that image exactly as provided, scaled to fit the display. The app interface should read as Persian (Farsi), RTL, with kids-friendly colors (bright cyan, orange, pinks, greens, playful gradients). Any visible UI must look cheerful, rounded, and child-appropriate.

**Text and branding – more text and effects:** Add several text elements around the phone with clear hierarchy and light effects:

1. **Main title – "سروکست" (Persian for SarvCast)**
   - Large, bold, kids-friendly rounded font (chunky and playful).
   - Apply a **bold kids-friendly 3D text effect**: soft bevel/emboss, gentle depth with a thick outline or layered shadow so the letters look slightly raised and toy-like. Use brand colors (e.g. cyan #00BCD4 or orange #FF5722) as fill, with a slightly darker shade for the 3D depth and a soft highlight on top edges.
   - Ensure the word "سروکست" is the dominant visual; right-to-left and properly aligned.

2. **Tagline in Persian**
   - Example: "داستان‌های صوتی برای کودکان" (Audio stories for children).
   - Medium size, below or beside the main title "سروکست".
   - Use a slightly lighter color (e.g. #424242 or #757575) with a very soft shadow or thin outline so it stays readable on the background.

3. **Short benefit or feature line**
   - Example: "هزاران داستان، یک اپلیکیشن" (Thousands of stories, one app) or "شنیدن داستان، لذت یادگیری" (Hear stories, enjoy learning).
   - Smaller size, placed where it balances the layout (e.g. below the tagline or on the opposite side of the phone).
   - Light gray or muted brand color, with a subtle soft shadow for depth.

4. **Website as rounded button at the bottom**
   - Place a **rounded (radius) button** at the **bottom of the mockup**, centered or slightly above the bottom edge.
   - Button text: **"SarvCast.ir"**.
   - Style: pill-shaped or fully rounded rectangle (large border radius), solid fill in brand cyan or orange (or a soft gradient). White or light text for "SarvCast.ir". Optional thin border or soft shadow so it reads as a clickable button. Size should be readable but not overpower the main title "سروکست".

**Text effects (apply subtly):**
- Main title "سروکست": bold kids-friendly 3D effect (bevel, depth, thick outline or layered shadow, slight highlight) so it feels fun and tactile.
- Soft drop shadows on other text so they read well on the gradient background.
- Very light outer glow on "سروکست" in cyan or orange if it fits the 3D look.
- Ensure all Persian text is right-to-left and properly aligned.

**Overall style:** Professional yet playful. **Background:** rich, smooth gradient (no white); **floating elements:** sparse and elegant (only a few larger glassy/3D shapes—no dense particles or confetti). The phone and text stay central; the scene feels premium, polished, and uncluttered, like a high-end app promo. Kids-friendly, vibrant color, and clear depth without visual noise.

**Important:** Use the uploaded SarvCast home page screenshot as the only content displayed on the phone screen. Do not invent or replace the app interface; only composite that provided image onto the phone display at the correct perspective and aspect ratio for a vertical smartphone screen.

## How to Use

1. Open **Gemini 3 Pro** and start a new conversation.
2. Copy the full prompt above (inside the code block).
3. Upload your **SarvCast app home page screenshot** as the second attachment (Image 2).
4. Send the prompt with the image.
5. If the background still feels too light, ask for: *"Use a richer, more saturated gradient—no white."* If there are still too many small elements, ask for: *"Use only 2–3 large floating shapes; no confetti or small particles."*
