## Database Changes

### New Tables Created:
1. **image_timelines**
   - `id` (Primary Key)
   - `episode_id` (Foreign Key)
   - `start_time` (Integer)
   - `end_time` (Integer)
   - `image_url` (String)
   - `image_order` (Integer)
   - `created_at`, `updated_at`

2. **story_comments**

   - Added `use_image_timeline` (Boolean) column

## API Endpoints Added

### Image Timeline Endpoints:
- `GET /episodes/{episodeId}/image-timeline` - Get timeline
- `POST /episodes/{episodeId}/image-timeline` - Create/update timeline
- `DELETE /episodes/{episodeId}/image-timeline` - Delete timeline
- `GET /episodes/{episodeId}/image-for-time?time=15` - Get image for time
- `GET /episodes/{episodeId}/timeline-statistics` - Get statistics
- `POST /timeline/validate` - Validate timeline data
- `POST /timeline/optimize` - Optimize timeline data

### Story Comment Endpoints:
- `GET /stories/{storyId}/comments` - Get story comments
- `POST /stories/{storyId}/comments` - Add comment
- `GET /comments/my-comments` - Get user's comments
- `DELETE /comments/{commentId}` - Delete user's comment
- `GET /stories/{storyId}/comments/statistics` - Get comment statistics

### Updated Endpoints:

## Security Features

### Timeline Security:
- Timeline validation prevents gaps and overlaps
- Image URL validation
- Time range validation
- Episode duration validation

### Comment Security:
- Rate limiting (5 minutes between comments)
- Comment approval workflow
- User can only delete their own comments
- Time restriction on comment deletion (1 hour)

## Performance Optimizations

### Timeline Performance:
- Database indexes on episode_id, start_time, end_time
- Caching with 1-hour TTL
- Timeline optimization (merging adjacent identical images)

### Comment Performance:
- Database indexes on story_id, user_id, created_at
- Pagination support
- Efficient querying with relationships

## Business Logic

### Timeline Business Rules:
1. Timeline must cover entire episode duration
2. No gaps between timeline segments
3. No overlaps between timeline segments
4. Images must be valid URLs
5. Timeline segments must be in chronological order

### Comment Business Rules:
1. Comments require approval before visibility
2. Users can only comment once every 5 minutes
3. Users can only delete their own comments
4. Comments can only be deleted within 1 hour of creation
5. All comments are moderated

## Error Handling

### Timeline Errors:
- Validation errors with specific messages
- Episode not found errors
- Timeline data validation errors
- Image URL validation errors

### Comment Errors:
- Rate limiting errors
- Permission errors
- Validation errors
- Not found errors

## Response Formats

### Timeline Responses:
```json
{
    "success": true,
    "message": "تایم‌لاین تصاویر دریافت شد",
    "data": {
        "episode_id": 1,
        "image_timeline": [...]
    }
}
```

### Comment Responses:
```json
{
    "success": true,
    "message": "نظرات داستان دریافت شد",
    "data": {
        "story_id": 1,
        "comments": [...],
        "pagination": {...}
    }
}
```

## Future Enhancements
