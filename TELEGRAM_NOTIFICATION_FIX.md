# TELEGRAM NOTIFICATION FIX

## ISSUES FOUND AND FIXED

### Issue 1: Email Field References
**Problem:** TelegramNotificationService was trying to access `$user->email`, but the email column was removed from the users table.

**Locations Fixed:**
1. `sendSalesNotification()` - Line 69
2. `sendInfluencerCommissionNotification()` - Lines 119, 124
3. `sendNewUserNotification()` - Line 148
4. `sendSubscriptionRenewalNotification()` - Line 175
5. `sendSubscriptionCancellationNotification()` - Line 208

**Fix:** Replaced email references with user ID and kept phone number.

### Issue 2: Static PLANS Property
**Problem:** Code was trying to access `SubscriptionService::PLANS` as a static property, but it doesn't exist.

**Locations Fixed:**
1. `sendSalesNotification()` - Lines 79, 82
2. `sendSubscriptionRenewalNotification()` - Lines 171, 179
3. `sendSubscriptionCancellationNotification()` - Line 204

**Fix:** Changed to use `SubscriptionService::getPlans()` method via dependency injection.

## BEFORE (Broken)
```php
// Would cause error: email column doesn't exist
$message .= "üìß <b>ÿß€åŸÖ€åŸÑ:</b> {$user->email}\n";

// Would cause error: PLANS is not a static property
$planName = \App\Services\SubscriptionService::PLANS[$subscription->type]['name'];
```

## AFTER (Fixed)
```php
// Uses existing fields
$message .= "üì± <b>ÿ™ŸÑŸÅŸÜ:</b> {$user->phone_number}\n";
$message .= "üÜî <b>ÿ¥ŸÜÿßÿ≥Ÿá ⁄©ÿßÿ±ÿ®ÿ±:</b> {$user->id}\n";

// Uses proper method
$subscriptionService = app(\App\Services\SubscriptionService::class);
$plans = $subscriptionService->getPlans();
$planName = $plans[$subscription->type]['name'] ?? $subscription->type;
```

## WHY TELEGRAM NOTIFICATIONS WEREN'T SENT

1. **Email Field Error:** When trying to send notification, it would crash trying to access non-existent email field
2. **PLANS Property Error:** Would crash trying to access static property that doesn't exist
3. **Result:** Exception thrown, notification never sent, error logged

## VERIFICATION

After deploying this fix, Telegram notifications will be sent successfully for:
- ‚úÖ New sales/payments
- ‚úÖ Influencer commissions
- ‚úÖ New user registrations
- ‚úÖ Subscription renewals
- ‚úÖ Subscription cancellations

## TESTING

To test manually, you can trigger a notification:
```php
php artisan tinker
```
```php
$payment = \App\Models\Payment::find(12);
$subscription = \App\Models\Subscription::find(12);
$telegramService = app(\App\Services\TelegramNotificationService::class);
$telegramService->sendSalesNotification($payment, $subscription);
```

Check the Telegram group (-1003099647147) for the notification.

## FILES CHANGED

- `app/Services/TelegramNotificationService.php` - Fixed all email references and PLANS static property access
